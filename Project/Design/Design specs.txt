1- You need to use Bootstrap latest version
2- You need to use FontAwesome font icon package (search from internet about what is it and how can you use it)
3- Use images which are included in images folder
4- Every page need to have same Header and footer sections
5- Active page need to be highlighted as you see in the design picture.
6- I want to reach every page I want with the links.
7- Portfolio items' links can be # (empty).

Good luck!
